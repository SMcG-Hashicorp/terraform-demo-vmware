# terraform-demo-vmware

## Prerequisites
1. VCS connection in place on staging and prod workspaces

develop a script to create workspaces
name-testing
name-staging
name-production
set workspace specific variables (environment)
set execution mode to agent (maybe)
connect VCS for staging and prod
generate remote_backend.tf files
apply sentinel policies

## Demo Script
1. old way (google it) vs new way (developer goes to PMR) (sign in using okta)
2. select module
3. show bare repo (this can be auto generated, repo, workspace as a service. put short lived creds in here as well)
4. create main.tf 9 lines and boom, commit to dev. (switch tfc token) [VCS driven] "this is important because it enables me to map from the changes in git to how it will impact my real life infra"
5. while itâ€™s provisioning show:
* workspaces
* run history
* state history + diffs
* variables
* RBAC
incorporate `terraform state show module.virtual-machine.vsphere_virtual_machine.vm`
6. now open PR, show speculative plan
7. show and explain sentinel policy as code
8. merge PR, show plans queued in both stage and prod
9. review and apply stage, then later review and apply prod
9. destroy [API driven] (`~/Developer/destroy.sh hashidemos a-tf-demo-vmware-TEST`)

## Completed Code
```
module "virtual-machine" {
  source  = "app.terraform.io/hashidemos/virtual-machine/vsphere"
  version = "0.1.2"

  app_name    = "ninjas-skunkworks-nginx"
  description = "a skunkworks project"
  environment = var.environment
  owner       = "008103"

  num_cpus  = "2"
  memory    = "2048"
  disk_size = "20"
}

variable "environment" {}

output "name" { value = module.virtual-machine.name }
output "ssh_ip" { value = module.virtual-machine.ssh_addr }
```
